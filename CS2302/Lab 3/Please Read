Sorry I didn't submit this lab when it was initially due. At the time I was working on this lab, I was having some personal problems,
so my progress on working on this was extremely slow. While I can't quite talk about these problems, in regards to the lab, 
one thing after another happened so that I figured that I would just stop and try to sort myself out. I figured that I would just take 
a loss as far as this lab goes, and just use that moment to sort myself out.
I would like to finish this lab at some point, if not to show that I know the material, but to make sure that I can write and 
program the necessary code for Binary Search Trees. I also understand that I should have talked to someone about this earlier, but at 
the time, I was just hoping to sweep this under the rug and, again, start with a clean slate. 
I understand that this is late, and will most likely not recieve a grade. but here is the code I had when we were initially working on it.
I'll try to finish it up by Saturday, 4/6.

I'll make sure this doesn't happen again, and if it should, I'll seek the necessary help ASAP.
Thank you.
